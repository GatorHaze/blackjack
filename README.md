https://github.com/GatorHaze/blackjack/tree/refactoring

#-Created a seperate class file for the game logic and named it gamelogic.cs
#-Moved the deck of cards to gamelogic.cs
#-moved the start of the game to gamelogic.cs making it cleaner with one line of code
#-Simplified integer variable definitions and put them on one line
#-Moved the card dealing to gamelogic.cs and simplified how you deal the players cards to the player and dealer
#-Seperated Player card action and the dealer card actions and put it in gamelogic.cs, calling it with one function for each, in program.cs
#-the code is now easier to follow and read
